        This website presents a comprehensive analysis and dietary strategy study based on food choices among college students. 
        Using Tableau visualizations, we explore how diet, preferences, and lifestyle intersect. The study aims to identify 
        key trends in student eating behaviors, health outcomes, and emotional associations with food. It provides visual insights 
        from real student data on factors such as cuisine preferences, calorie intake, cooking frequency, and comfort food choices. 
        The platform integrates data analytics with user-friendly dashboards and stories to help students and stakeholders understand 
        the dietary patterns in academic settings. Explore each section to view Tableau dashboards, story visuals, and a deep dive 
        into our findings. This project supports better decision-making and promotes a culture of informed eating on campus.

      <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        This project originated as an academic case study to investigate the dietary patterns of college students. The goal is to 
        understand the underlying factors that influence students' food choices, including convenience, cultural background, health 
        awareness, and emotional well-being. Using Tableau Public for visualization, we collected and analyzed data from surveys 
        covering aspects such as meal frequency, cooking habits, exercise routines, and nutritional check awareness. The insights 
        derived help institutions design better dietary support systems, cafeterias, and mental health initiatives. It also offers 
        a unique intersection of data science and behavioral science applied to student life. Our analysis offers actionable 
        recommendations for improving student wellness, and showcases how data visualization can communicate complex human behavior 
        effectively.

      <h3>Story 1 - Cooking Frequency & Food Preference</h3>
      <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/Wb3c756k/Screenshot-38.png" alt="Story 1 Tableau Visualization">
      <p>
        Story 1 focuses on the cooking frequency of students and their food preferences. The visualization reveals how students' 
        time constraints, cultural influences, and access to cooking facilities affect their meal choices. We noticed that students 
        who cook frequently tend to have a better understanding of nutrition and report higher satisfaction with their meals. The 
        story also highlights the role of comfort food in stress management. Pasta, snacks, and sweets were common comfort foods, 
        especially during exams. By analyzing patterns in cooking frequency, schools can offer targeted workshops to encourage 
        healthy cooking habits. The visual story helps stakeholders understand the gap between intention and behavior in college 
        diets.

      <h3>Story 2 - Calorie Intake & Health Awareness</h3>
      <img src="https://i.postimg.cc/QCNCmc0d/Screenshot-40.png" alt="Story 2 Tableau Visualization">
      <p>
        Story 2 explores the relationship between calorie consumption and students' health awareness. The data reveals that while 
        many students claim to monitor their diet, only a small percentage actively check nutritional labels or consult dietary 
        guidelines. A large portion consumes excess calories through snacks and beverages without realizing their impact. This 
        discrepancy between perceived and actual diet quality indicates a need for better nutritional education. The story shows 
        calorie consumption trends across gender, BMI categories, and exercise frequency. These findings are useful for campus 
        health services looking to reduce obesity rates and promote balanced diets. Tableau helped us illustrate these complex 
        dynamics clearly and interactively.

      <h3>Insights and Analysis</h3>

      <p>
        The analysis from the Tableau dashboards and stories provided several key insights. Students' dietary habits are largely 
        influenced by lifestyle choices, time availability, and social factors. Those who cook regularly and exercise tend to 
        report better mental health and academic performance. Comfort food preferences often correlate with emotional stress and 
        coping behaviors. Interestingly, while students are aware of healthy eating principles, many fail to implement them due 
        to budget or time constraints. The dashboards showed clear differences in diet patterns based on gender and marital status. 
        Insights from this study can guide universities in implementing meal plans, workshops, and policies to support student well-being. 
        This case study demonstrates how data visualization tools like Tableau can turn raw data into meaningful narratives that drive 
        actionable change.
